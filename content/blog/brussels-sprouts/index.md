Brussels sprouts were one of those "adult" foods I just never grew into. After what seemed like a requisite number of years following our graduation from college, friends and colleagues began to talk about brussels sprouts being a staple in their weekday diet and it absoultely baffled me. Brussels sprouts? Yep.

What changed my mind? I found a recipe by Mark Bittman for roasting the little green goddesses to sheer perfection. I've adapted the recipe here.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb brussels sprouts, rinsed, ends trimmed, and cut in half top to bottom
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled with woody ends cut off
- Olive oil
- 1 lemon (optional)
- Salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 and set a heavy skillet over medium high heat on the stove. Coat the skillet with a generous amount of oil. When it shimmers, add brussels sprouts cut side down. Nestle garlic cloves among the sprouts, sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. Cook until sprouts begin browning on the bottom, then transfer to the oven. Roast until very brown on bottom and tender, shaking the pan every 5 min to prevent sticking. Should take 10-20 min.

3. To finish, squeeze a lemon over the sprouts. Adjust salt and pepper as necessary.
