## Directions

0. Make the cashew cream: Combine the cashews and water in blender and blend until very, very smooth.
1. Combine all the marinade ingredients and let sit for 4 hours or overnight.
2. Heat oil and 1T butter over medium heat. Brown chicken in batches (do not overcrowd the pan!), then remove to a plate.
