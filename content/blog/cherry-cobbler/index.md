My grandma used to make this dessert all the time as we grew up. Delicious with ice cream or spooned into oatmeal.

## Ingredients

- 1 box yellow cake mix (Grandma recommends Betty Crocker)
- 21 oz cherry pie filling
- 1 pint frozen blueberries
- 1.5 sticks salted butter, melted

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350

2. Spread cherry pie filling evenly across a 9x13 pan, then top with blueberries

3. Sprinkle cake mix over berries, then shake pan to evenly distribute crumbs

4. Pour butter evenly over cake mix

5. Bake for 30-40 min or until light golden brown, then cool in pan 5-10 min before serving

6. To serve, stir in crumbs as you scoop. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you wish
