The first year I made these, my grandfather told me that in his 90 years of life, cranberries were the one food his family ate every year, even through poverty and the Great Depression. Out of all those cranberries, these were his favorite. I hope you enjoy them as well.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz cranberries, rinsed, picked over, and divided 
- 1c minus 3T sugar
- 2T water
- Zest of 1 orange
- Pinch cinnamon (optional) 
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Set aside 2/3 cup cranberries. Add the remainder to a large bottomed saucepan along with sugar, water, and orange zest. Turn the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves.
2. Turn the heat up to medium. Add the cinnamon, if using. Cook until cranberries begin to burst. 
3. Turn off the heat. Stir in reserved cranberries and fold them in carefully, letting the residual heat cook them. Season sauce to taste with salt and fresh ground pepper. Sauce is done when the new berries are just shy of bursting.
