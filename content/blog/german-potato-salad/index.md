Quick, easy, and great with just about everything, from hamburgers to fried pork cutlets. Need I say more? Okay, fine... it's also full of bacon.

Like many foods I make, this dish is not at all authentic. However, it is truly delicious. Inspired by my grandma Jean, I set out to make my own version of the warm, bacon-dressed potato salad I'd heard her tell stories of from her childhood. Here's the result! Hope you enjoy.

## Ingredients

-   1.5 lbs red potatoes, cleaned and cut into 1" pieces
-   4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced
-   1 small red onion, diced
-   Handful fresh parsley

For the dressing, mix and set aside

-   1/4c vinegar (I use mostly white, but you can throw in a splash of apple cider or malt if you like)
-   3T sugar
-   2T water
-   1t salt
-   Black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Boil potatoes until tender. Drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, fry bacon until crisp and then transfer to a plate covered with paper towels to drain. If desired, you can drain off up to half of the bacon grease.
3. Add onion to grease. Cook over medium heat until brown around the edges, then add dressing.
4. Bring to boil and stir, making sure sugar is dissolved, then pour over potatoes and fold gently.
5. Stir in bacon bits and parsley. Serve warm.
