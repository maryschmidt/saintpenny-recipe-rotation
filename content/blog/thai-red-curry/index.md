This is a base recipe for a Thai red curry I make almost weekly with whatever's in season. I like to make it with vegetables but you could easily add chicken for more protein. What's presented here is a wintry take on the curry.

## Directions

1. Toss ½ kaboucha squash (or butternut, acorn, etc.) or 2 diced sweet potatoes, 2 carrots, bit of oil, brown sugar, chili flakes, soy sauce, salt, pepper—roast at 400 until tender

2. Meanwhile, start the curry. Heat 1T oil and add 1 diced onion. Cook on medium heat until onions melt and start to brown. Add 1T garlic and 1T ginger and cook for 1min. Add 1 thinly sliced red bell pepper and cook until barely tender, about 5 min.

3. Add 3-4T Thai red curry paste (make sure you find a vegan one) and cook for another 2 min. Add 1 can full fat coconut milk, 1/2c water, squeeze of ketchup, splash of soy sauce (kecap manis would be tasty here), spoonful of brown sugar, and a pinch of good chili flakes. Bring to a simmer, then add roasted veggies. Let simmer on low until flavors come together.

4. Turn off the heat and adjust the seasonings. Squeeze a lime over the curry or stir in a spoonful of rice vinegar (other vinegars can work too, just need the acid). Serve with brown or white rice and garnish with Thai basil if you have it.

## Variations and add-ons

- Potatoes (red, gold, mini are all great)
- Roasted cauliflower 
- Greens: Stir in kale with the coconut milk or spinach at the very end
- Grate in some apple for sweetness and serve with apple slices to dip into the curry (thanks, Julia’s!)
