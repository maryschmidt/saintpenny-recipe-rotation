What's more personal than a chili recipe? This is my own chili recipe, inspired by my mother's and my time spent in Boston. Hope you enjoy it!

## Ingredients

- 1.5lbs ground beef
- 2/3c kidney beans
- 1/3c garbanzo beans
- 1/3c black beans
- 1 small onion
- 1T garlic
- 2T tomato paste 
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into bites 
- 3 Anaheim chilies, cut into bites
- 4c bean stock — from cooking beans
- 1 can whole tomatoes
- 2t salt, pepper to taste
- 1T + 1t chili powder
- 1T paprika (reg or smoked)
- 1/2t cayenne
- 1.5t cocoa powder
- 1T vinegar
- Bacon — 4 strips
- Fresh cilantro (optional)

## Directions

1. Soak beans overnight in giant mixing bowl of water in the fridge.

2. The next day, drain beans and cook them in a pot of fresh water until tender.

3. Meanwhile, heat 1T oil over medium heat. Cook onion until just translucent, then add garlic and cook for 30 sec. then add beef, break up, and cook until brown. Next, add tomato paste, then peppers. Cook until softened slightly before adding beans, broth, tomatoes and spices. Simmer for an hour or so until flavors come together. 

4. Finally, cook bacon in a separate pan. Sprinkle bacon with brown sugar and maple syrup while still raw in the pan. It will make a sticky mess but it’s good. When the bacon’s done, transfer the whole strips to the chili pot to soak.

5. Spoon into bowls and garnish with whatever you so like 

    - Cilantro
    - Hot sauce
    - Sour cream
    - Cheddar cheese
    - Fritos
